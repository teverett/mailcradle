# MailCradle

MailCradle is a server-side system for sorting, deleting, and forwarding mail on an IMAP Server

## Why is it named MailCradle?

There is mail that is important, and mail that can be read and responded to later.  Typically, I like to store the messages that need immediate attention in my INBOX, and automatically move all other mail into folders to process at a convenient time. In short, I want to separate the urgent mail from all other mail, and sort the mail that's not urgent.

The sorting process is similar to [winnowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnowing), and that tool that has been used for centuries to winnow grain is a *cradle*.  Therefore, I named the program MailCradle.  Another name for a cradle is a [winnowing- fan](https://www.google.com/search?q=winnowing+fan), if you're interested to learn a bit about it.
